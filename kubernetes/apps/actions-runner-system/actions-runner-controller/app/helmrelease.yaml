# The *secret refers to an anchor in the YAML file that is being used to specify the
#  secret's name. This is a YAML feature that allows defining an anchor (using the & character)
#  and then referencing it (using the * character) to avoid duplicating the same value in
#  multiple places within the file. In this case, *secret refers to the value assigned to name
#  in the authSecret section of the HelmRelease YAML file.

# The tls section specifies the TLS configuration for the ingress controller. The hosts
# subsection under tls specifies the same hostnames that were defined in the hosts section,
# using the reference to &host. This configuration tells the ingress controller to use TLS
# encryption for traffic that matches the specified hostnames.


#  githubWebhookServer refers to a component of the actions-runner-controller Helm chart that
#  enables the runner to automatically register itself as a self-hosted runner with GitHub.
#   The GitHub webhook server listens for events from the GitHub repository where the runner
#    is registered and then updates the runner with the latest metadata.

# The githubWebhookServer component creates an HTTPS server to handle incoming webhook requests
#  from GitHub. When an event is received, the webhook server triggers a sync of the runner
#   configuration, which ensures that the runner is up-to-date with the latest repository
#   and runner metadata. This allows the runner to stay in sync with the repository it is
#   registered to, enabling it to automatically pick up new workflows and jobs as they are
#   added to the repository
