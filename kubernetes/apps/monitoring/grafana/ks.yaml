# The naming conventions for resources are typically determined by the organization or project's naming conventions and
# standards. In Kubernetes, it's common to use a combination of labels, namespaces, and resource names to provide meaningful
# names that reflect the purpose or characteristics of the resource.


# In the given snippet, if the "monitoring" prefix is desired, it would need to be specified explicitly in the metadata.name
# field or in the directory structure of the Kustomization path. For example, if the Kustomization path is "./monitoring/
# grafana", it would result in the following resource name: "monitoring-grafana".
